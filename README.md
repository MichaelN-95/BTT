# Better Ticket Tracker

This is a work in progress project for my dissertation, the end goal is to simulate what a self hosted ticketing system could look like.

Inspiration for this came from a charity event hosted by a local football club where tickets were printed, sold and used for entry. I wanted to see if a small self hosted solution that can be used by town/county committees would be feasible and easier track ticket sales and avoid loss of tickets.

The end result will be bundled together via docker and docker-compose to allow it to be deployed either locally or on a cloud provider.
